## ü¶ú About Ibis
_Ibis_ is designed to revolutionize the way we interact with web pages by eliminating the need for traditional interfaces like keyboards and mouse clicks. Inspired by the vision of seamless human-computer interaction, _Ibis_ leverages **OpenAI-compatible endpoints** to provide a **hands-free**, **voice-controlled** web development and design experience.

With over **30 years** of full-stack web development experience, I created _Ibis_ to streamline the web development process, allowing you to **code, design, and iterate** on web applications effortlessly using just your voice.
