## ü¶ú About Ibis
_Ibis_ is designed to revolutionize the way we interact with web pages by eliminating the need for traditional interfaces like keyboards and mouse clicks. Inspired by the vision of seamless human-computer interaction, _Ibis_ leverages **OpenAI-compatible endpoints** to provide a **hands-free**, **voice-controlled** web development and design experience.

With over **30 years** of full-stack web development experience, I created _Ibis_ to streamline the web development process, allowing you to **code, design, and iterate** on web applications effortlessly using just your voice.

## üåü Features
- **Hands-Free Control:** Navigate and manipulate web pages using voice commands.
- **AI-Powered Development:** Generate and refine JavaScript code dynamically without touching the keyboard.
- **Local LLM Compatibility:** Easily switch between OpenAI servers and local language models using the `llmServer` variable.
- **Progress Indicators:** Sleek, full-width progress bars to keep track of ongoing tasks.
- **Speech Synthesis Queue:** Seamlessly queue multiple speech outputs without interruptions.
- **Self-Contained & Open Source:** Fully client-side application with no server dependencies. [Contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/lks-ai/ibis).
