# Ibis
Ibis is a Hands-Free Interactive Web Page. Using the latest generative AI, it can be Any Page.

## Toward Human Interfaces
Mark Zuckerberg in recent interviews talks about this exact thing, albeit in a different context. No websites, no search engines, no forms or interactive apps, just a natural human interface with zero learning curve. We already have to learn so much, we get stuck with all of these vestigial skills which atrophy as technology progresses. You already had to learn how to speak your natal language and many other human interfaces, then to use computers you were forced to learn the computer interface because the control mechanism was not at par with human interfaces. In development, the lower the learning curve, the higher the level of operation you can ideate at. The quicker you bring your ideas into reality, the faster you can iterate. You surely wouldn't want to have to create a social network in assembly language would you? all of the languages built on top of that have been ... patches to a non-existent bridge between human interfaces and computer interfaces.

I wasn't born with the ability to type this message into this keyboard at 100 words per minute. It was a necessary evil to control computers at the depth I wanted to control them back in the 90s. Do I want to keep typing code into a screen my whole life? No. Now, at least for website design, I kinda don't have to.

## The point of Ibis
The goal of this project (I'm calling Ibis) was to make a web development/design experience based on the latest technology, hands-free design and full voice control, where I can code a fully working web app... anything I want, and I can refine it, focus on certain elements and end up with something I actually want, without touching my keyboard once. Some of you may have seen my work in AnyNode for ComfyUI which essentially does the same thing for image generation, except without voice. It took me a weekend to get to a demo of AnyNode. It took me an hour to get to a demo of this, and I spent the rest of my time playing with it imagining the possibilities of this new take at an interface to the internet which I think is much closer to a human level interface than anything else we've had the ability to code before.
Open Source, Self Contained

## How to Use
Put your OpenAI API key in. Yes I know. It should use local LLMs. I will have o1 do that tomorrow... or you can... open source! If you do make cool versions of this, for sure post back.
What should we have it do?

## Conclusions
I realize that this is very new territory even for me. I have asked it to `save the page content with it's on head and title` ... and it literally downloaded the content nicely formatted! so... yeah, I mean some things that you think should be features might already be built into this paradigm. Either way, have fun!
